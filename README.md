# Table of Contents

## General Information
- Develop a basic understanding of risk analytics in banking and financial services and understand how data is used to minimise the risk of losing money while lending to customers

## Project background
- Aim of this project is to identify predictors of default so during loan application we can use those variables for loan approval/rejection.

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
- Answer: Wants to understand the driving factors (variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.
  So the company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

- What is the dataset that is being used?
- Answer: CSV file (loan.csv) contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.

## Conclusions
- Banks should focus more on Senior levels or high experienced person for Rented ownership and middle level for owned assets.

- People who have high loan to annual income ratio are at high risk of default for Verified Source Income.

- Maximum loan applications have been received and hence high is the defaulting probability in these categories:
  1) Debt consolidation 2) Credit card 3) Home improvement 4) Others 5) Major purchase

- Get as much as clients from housing type with owned asset.
